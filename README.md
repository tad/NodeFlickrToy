Tad's NodeFlickrToy

INSTRUCTIONS: To build: Windows: just run jake from command line.  If you're not on windows, you'll need to create a
bash script to run jake for you.

This is just a super simple web toy / experiment with TDD, javascript and node.js plus whatever node modules I need to
make everything work.

Eventually this will be a really simple single page web app that will grab recent flickr photos and then create a
web page showing each of the pics with links back to the original flickr photo page.

I'm attempting to do this at strictly TDD as possible.

I have a similar version of this on github that's written in Asp.Net MVC and c#.
